# better-vivaldi

My recommendations for the ultimate configuration of the Vivaldi Browser :)

**NOTE:** This project can be found on both [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-vivaldi), which will act as the main & preferred way to contribute, and [GitHub](https://github.com/celenityy/better-vivaldi).

**NOTE:** This is specifically tailored for Vivaldi on Desktop. For Android, see [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-vivaldi-android).

# Start Page

On Vivaldi's Start Page/Speed Dial, feel free to remove the built-in sponsored links.

# Bookmarks

Similarly, I'd also recommend deleting the built-in sponsored bookmarks, as well as the `Vivaldi` folder.

# Sidebar

I usually also remove the links to `Vivaldi Social` & `Vivaldi's Help Center` from the sidebar here as well.

# vivaldi://flags

**#block-insecure-private-network-requests** -> `Enabled`

**#content-settings-partitioning** -> `Enabled`

**#enable-parallel-downloading** -> `Enabled`

**#private-network-access-permission-prompt** -> `Enabled`

**#reduce-accept-language** -> `Enabled`

**#strict-origin-isolation** -> `Enabled`

**#third-party-storage-partitioning** -> `Enabled`

# Additional recommendations

* Keep extensions to a minimum and only install what you actually need. Having unnecessary extensions reduces performance, increases attack surface, increases fingerprintability, etc.

* Similarly, [please don't use more than one content blocking extension](https://x.com/gorhill/status/1033706103782170625).

* Use a private, secure, & reputable DNS provider of your choice. I would recommend setting up your own [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) configuration if you are able to *(See my recommendations for NextDNS [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/nextdns-settings))*, otherwise I would recommend [Quad9](https://quad9.net/).

* Use a (reputable) VPN. I would recommend either [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) or [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).

* Use a (reputable) anti-virus if possible. On Windows, you can use the built-in [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Defender_Antivirus), on macOS, you can stick to the built-in [XProtect](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/protecting-against-malware-sec469d47bd8/web), and on Linux, you can use [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/).
